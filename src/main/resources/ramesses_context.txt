This research is exploring the practitioners' view of a proposed reference software architecture that leverages metadata for promoting reusability in services. The interesting results should point towards three aspects: Acknowledgement, where participants sign having (or not) used similar structures or solutions; Applicability, indicating scenarios or conditions in which the reference architecture could be a valuable resource; and Consequences, that can be benefits or liabilities from using the reference architecture.
